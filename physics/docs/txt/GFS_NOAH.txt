\section des_noah 1. Description
 Land-atmosphere interactions are a main driver of Earth's surface
 water and energy budgets. The importance of the land surface is
 rather intuitive, and has been demonstrated not only in terms of
 predictability on daily to seasonal timescale (Betts et al. 2017
 \cite betts_et_al_2017), but also in terms
 of influencing extremes such as drought and heatwaves (PaiMazumder and
 Done, 2016 \cite paimazumder_and_done_2016), PBL evolution and cloud
 formation (Milovac  et al. 2016 \cite milovac_et_al_2016) and afternoon
 convection (Guillod et al. 2015 \cite guillod_et_al_2015), and
 tropical cyclone re-intensification (Andersen and Shepherd, 2014
 \cite andersen_and_shepherd_2014). Other linkages, such as the role of soil
 moisture (SM) or vegetation heterogeneity in mesoscale circulation
 (Hsu et al. 2017 \cite hsu_et_al_2017) and planetary waves (Koster
 et al. 2014 \cite koster_et_al_2014), and those driven by land use
 and land cover change or management (Hirsch et al. 2015
 \cite hirsch_et_al_2015, Findell et al. 2017
 \cite findell_et_al_2017) are topics of active research.

 Figure 1 is a schematic of local land-atmosphere interactions in a
 quiescent synoptic regime, including the soil moisture-precipitation
 (SM-P) feedback pathways.  Solid arrows indicate a positive feedback
 pathway, and large dashed arrows represent a negative feedback, while
 red indicates radiative, black indicates surface layer and PBL, and
 brown indicates land surface processes. Thin red and grey dashed lines
 with arrows also represent positive feedbacks. The single horizontal
 gay-dotted line (no arrows) indicates the top of the PBL, and the seven
 small vertical dashed lines (no arrows) represent precipitation

 The land-surface model component was substantially upgraded from the Oregon
 State University (OSU) land surface model to EMC's new NOAH Land Surface Model
 (NOAH LSM) during the major implementation in the NCEP Global Forecast System
 (GFS) on May 31, 2005. Forecast System (GFS). The NOAH LSM embodies about 10
 years of upgrades (see Chen et al. 1996
 \cite chen_et_al_1996; Koren et al. 1999 \cite koren_et_al_1999; Ek et al. 2003
 \cite ek_et_al_2003) to its ancestor, the OSU LSM.  The NOAH LSM upgrade includes:
 - An increase from two (10, 190 cm thick) to four soil layers (10, 30, 60, 100 cm thick)
 - Addition of frozen soil physics
 - Add glacial ice treatment
 - Two snowpack states (SWE, density)
 - New  formulations for infiltration and runoff account for sub-grid variability in precipitation and soil moisture
 - Revised physics of the snowpack and its influence on surface heat fluxes and albedo
 - Higher canopy resistance
 - Spatially  varying root depth
 - Surface fluxes weighted by snow cover fraction
 - Improved thermal conduction in soil/snow
 - Improved seasonality of green vegetation cover.
 - Improved evaporation treatment over bare soil and snowpack
