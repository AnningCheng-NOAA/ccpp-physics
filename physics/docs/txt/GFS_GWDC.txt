\section des_gwdc 1. Description
 The GFS orographic gravity wave drag parameterization calculates the
 effect of gravity waves produced by uneven distribution of diabatic
 heat sources asscociated with convective systems on the
 horizontal wind.

 At present, global models must be run with horizontal resolutions
 that cannot typically resolve atmospheric phenomena shorter than
 ~10-100 km or greater for weather prediction and ~100-1000 km or
 greater for climate predicition. Many atmospheric processes have
 shorter horizontal scales than these "subgrid-scale" processes
 interact with and affect the larger-scale atmosphere in important
 ways.

 Atmospheric gravity waves are one such unresolved processes. These
 waves are generated by lower atmospheric sources. e.g., flow over
 irregularities at the Earth's surface such as mountains and valleys,
 uneven distribution of diabatic heat sources asscociated with
 convective systems, and highly dynamic atmospheric processes such
 as jet streams and fronts. The dissipation of these waves produces
 synoptic-scale body forces on the atmospheric flow, known as
 "gravity wave drag"(GWD), which affects both short-term evolution
 of weather systems and long-term climate. However, the spatial
 scales of these waves (in the range of ~5-500 km horizontally) are
 too short to be fully captured in models, and so GWD must be
 parameterized. In addition, the role of GWD in driving the global
 middle atmosphere circulation and thus global mean wind/temperature
 structures is well established. Thus, GWD parametrizations are now
 critical components of virtually all large-scale atmospheric models.
 GFS physics includes parameterizations of gravity waves from two
 important sources: mountains and convection. This parameterization
 addresses the latter.

 In a review paper on gravity waves in the middle atmosphere, Fritts
 (1984) \cite fritts_1984 showed that a large portion of observed
 gravity wave momentum flux has higher frequencies than those of
 stationary mountain waves. This phenomenon was explained by cumulus
 convection, which is an additional source of tropospheric gravity
 waves, and is particularly important in summertime. When the surface
 wind and stability are weak, the magnitude of the surface drag and
 the resultant influence of orographically-induced gravity wave drag
 on the large-scale flow are relatively small compared with those in
 wintertime (Palmer et al. 1986 \cite palmer_et_al_1986). In this
 situation, the relative importance of cumulus convection as a source
 of gravity waves is larger. In addition, in the tropical regions
 where persistent convection exists, deep cumulus clouds impinging on
 the stable stratosphere can generate gravity waves that influence
 the large-scale flow.

\subsection provenance_gwdc Provenance
 The parameterization of stationary convectively-forced GWD follows
 the development of Chun and Baik (1998) \cite chun_and_baik_1998 ,
 which was tested in GCMs by Chun et al. (2001,2004)
 \cite chun_et_al_2001 \cite chun_et_al_2004 was implemented in GFS
 by Ake Johansson (2008) and the work of the GCWMB staff. Modest
 positive effects from using the parameterization are seen in the
 tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.
