\section des_gwdc 1. Description
 GFS physics includes parameterizations of gravity waves from two
 important sources: mountains and convection. This parameterization
 addresses the latter.

 In a review paper on gravity waves in the middle atmosphere, Fritts
 (1984) \cite fritts_1984 showed that a large portion of observed
 gravity wave momentum flux has higher frequencies than those of
 stationary mountain waves. This phenomenon was explained by cumulus
 convection, which is an additional source of tropospheric gravity
 waves, and is particularly important in summertime. When the surface
 wind and stability are weak, the magnitude of the surface drag and
 the resultant influence of orographically-induced gravity wave drag
 on the large-scale flow are relatively small compared with those in
 wintertime (Palmer et al. 1986 \cite palmer_et_al_1986). In this
 situation, the relative importance of cumulus convection as a source
 of gravity waves is larger. In addition, in the tropical regions
 where persistent convection exists, deep cumulus clouds impinging on
 the stable stratosphere can generate gravity waves that influence
 the large-scale flow.

 Parameterizing subgrid-scale convection-induced gravity wave
 momentum flux for use in large-scale models inherently requires
 some information from subgrid-scale cumulus parameterization.
 The methodology for parameterizing the zonal momentum flux induced
 by thermal forcing can be summarized as follows. From the cloud-base
 to cloud-top height, the effect of the momentum flux
 induced by subgrid-scale diabatic forcing is not considered because
 subgrid-scale cumulus convection in large-scale models is only
 activated in a conditionally unstable atmosphere. Below the cloud
 base, the momentum flux is also not considered because of the wave
 momentum cancellation. At the cloud top, the momentum flux is
 obtained by eq.(18) and (19) in Chun and Baik (1998)
 \cite chun_and_baik_1998.  Above the cloud top, there are two ways to
 construct the momentum flux profile. One way is to specify a
 vertical structure of the momentum flux normalized by the cloud-top
 value, similar to what has been done for mountain drag
 parameterization. The other way is to apply the wave saturation
 hypothesis in order to find wave breaking levels in terms of the
 Richardon number criterion using the nonlinearity factor of
 thermally induced waves.
