\section des_zhao 1. Description
 The GFS scheme for large-scale condensation and precipitation
 , based on Zhao and Carr (1997) \cite zhao_and_carr_1997
 and Sundqvist et al. (1989) \cite sundqvist_et_al_1989 .

 \details Figure 1 shows a  schematic illustration of this scheme.
 There are two sources of prognostic cloud condensate, convective
 detrainment (see convection) and grid-sale
 condensate. The sinks of cloud condensate are grid-scale
 precipitation and evaporation of the cloud condensate. Evaporation
 of rain in the unsaturated layers below the level of condensation
 is also taken into account. All precipitation that penetrates the
 lowest atmospheric layer is allowed to fall to the surface.
 Subsequent to the May 2001 implementation, excessive amounts of
 light precipitation were noted. This was addressed through a minor
 implementation in August 2001, which involved a slight modification
 of the autoconversion rate of ice. At the same time, an
 empirically-based calculation of the effective radius for ice
 crystals (Heymsfield and McFarquhar 1996
 \cite heymsfield_and_mcfarquhar_1996) was introduced.

 -# For precipitation process:
 The parameterization of precipitation is required in order to remove
 water from the atmosphere and transport it to the ground. In the
 scheme discussed here, simplifications in the precipitation
 parameterization are used due to computational limitations required
 by operational NWP models. First, consideration of particle size and
 shape can be avoided by using the bulk parameterization method
 introduced by Kessler (1969) \cite kessler_1969. Second, only two
 types of precipitation, rain and snow, are considered in this
 scheme. Third, only the most important microphysical processes
 associated with the formation of rain and snow are included.
 Figure 2 presents the microphysical processes considered in the
 precipitation parameterization.

 Basically, there are four types of microphysical processes
 considered here:
 - production of rain from cloud water
 (\f$P_{racw}\f$, \f$P_{raut}\f$, \f$P_{sacw}\f$)
 - production of snow from cloud ice
 (\f$P_{saut}\f$, \f$P_{saci}\f$)
 - melting of snow to form rain below the freezing level
 (\f$P_{sm1}\f$, \f$P_{sm2}\f$)
 - the evaporation of precipitation
 (\f$E_{rr}\f$, \f$E_{rs}\f$)

 The following two equations can be used to calculate the
 precipitation rates of rain and snow at each module level:
\f[
 P_{r}(\eta)=\frac{p_{s}-p_{t}}{g\eta_{s}}\int_{\eta}^{\eta_{t}}(P_{raut}+P_{racw}+P_{sacw}+P_{sm1}+P_{sm2}-E_{rr})d\eta
\f]
 and
\f[
 P_{s}(\eta)=\frac{p_{s}-p_{t}}{g\eta_{s}}\int_{\eta}^{\eta_{t}}(P_{saut}+P_{saci}-P_{sm1}-P_{sm2}-E_{rs})d\eta
\f]
 where \f$p_{s}\f$ and\f$p_{t}\f$ are the surface pressure and the
 pressure at the top of model domain, respectively, and \f$g\f$ is
 gravity. The implementation of the precipitation scheme also
 includes a simplified procedure of computing \f$P_{r}\f$
 and \f$P_{s}\f$ (Zhao and Carr(1997) \cite zhao_and_carr_1997).
