\section des_rough  1. Description
 It is the surface roughness length formulation based on
 the surface sublayer scheme from Zeng and Dickinson (1998)
 \cite zeng_and_dickinson_1998.

 NOAH LSM are largely responsible for the quality
 of model forecasts produced for near-surface weather parameters, such
 as 2-meter air temperature (\a T2m) and surface skin temperature
 (\a LST). LST is derived from the surface energy budget, and is
 particularly important to remote sensing and data  assimilation. How
 precise these two parameters can be simulated by the model strongly
 dependes on how accurate the surface heat fluxes are parameterized,
 particularly the surface sensible heat flux (\a SH). The surface
 thermal roughness length is a key parameter to determine \a SH.
 Previous GFS version do not distinguish between the roughness length
 for heat and momentum. The aerodynamic roughness \f$Z_{0m}\f$ is used
 for wind, while the thermal roughness \f$Z_{0t}\f$ is used for heat and
 water vapor. In general,\f$Z_{0m}\f$ is different from \f$Z_{0t}\f$,
 because the transfer of momentum is affected by pressure fluctuations
 in the turbulent waves behind the roughness elements, while for heat
 and water vapor transfer no such dynamical mechanism exists. Zeng and
 Dickinson (1998) \cite zeng_and_dickinson_1998 found that the surface
 skin temperature can be at least 10 K higher when considering the surface
 sublayer (or the variable ratio of the \f$Z_{0m}/Z_{0t}\f$ than without
 in the desert summer afternoon.

 In May 2011, the new vegetation-dependent formulations of
 momentum and thermal roughness formulation (Zheng et al. 2009
 \cite zheng_et_al_2009; Zheng et al. 2012 \cite zheng_et_al_2012 )
 was implemented to deal with the cold LST bias
 over the arid western continental United States
 (CONUS) during daytime. This LST bias contributes to large errors in
 simulated satellite brightness temperatures over land by the Community
 Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and hence the rejection of satellite
 data in the NCEP Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system,
 especially for surface-sensitive satellite channels.

 Zheng et al.(2009) \cite zheng_et_al_2009 proposed a new formulation on
 \f$ln(Z_{0m}^,/Z_{0t})\f$ as follows:
\f[
  ln(Z_{0m}^,/Z_{0t})=(1-GVF)^2C_{zil}k(u*Z_{0g}/\nu)^{0.5}
\f]
 where \f$Z_{0m}^,\f$ is the effective momentum roughness length
 computed in the following equation for each grid, \f$Z_{0t}\f$
 is the roughness lenghth for heat, \f$C_{zil}\f$ is a coefficient
 (taken as 0.8), k is the Von Karman constant (0.4),
 \f$\nu=1.5\times10^{-5}m^{2}s^{-1}\f$ is the molecular viscosity,
 \f$u*\f$ is the friction velocity, and \f$Z_{0g}\f$ is the bare
 soil roughness length for momentum (taken as 0.01).
 \n In order to consider the convergence of \f$Z_{0m}\f$ between
 fully vegetated and bare soil, the effective \f$Z_{0m}^,\f$ is
 computed:
\f[
  \ln(Z_{0m}^,)=(1-GVF)^{2}\ln(Z_{0g})+\left[1-(1-GVF)^{2}\right]\ln(Z_{0m})
\f]

(a) Difference between GFS and GOES in the control run at 18:00 UTC; (b) Difference between GFS and GOES with the new formulation run at 18:00 UTC, averaged from 1 to 3 July 2007" width=10cm

 Figure 1 show the 3 day average land surface skin temperature predicted
 by the GFS and comparison with the GOES-derived satellite measurements.
 At 18:00 UTC (midday in local time over the central United States) in
 the control run (Figure 1a), a substantial cold bias can be found over
 the west half of CONUS (i.e., arid or semiarid regions). The new roughness
 length formulations significantly reduce the cold bias in the western
 CONUS, while the LST in the eastern CONUS, where the bias is small in
 the control run, is not much affected.

 The Desert Rock station (\f$36.63^oN\f$, \f$116.02^oW\f$), located in the Nevada
 desert,is one of the observation stations within the SURFRAD network.
 The GOES-derived LST is very similar to the SURFRAD obervations (Figure 2).
 However, the old GFS run produces very low LST, compared to the observations,
 especially during daytime. During midday, the cold bias can reach up to
 \f$-15^oC\f$. The new formulation run produces a reasonable LST diurnal cycle.
 The daytime LST increases substantially and is very close to the observations.
