\section des_ozone 1. Description
 The operational GFS currently parameterizes ozone production and
 destruction based on monthly mean coefficients provided by Naval
 Research Laboratory through CHEM2D chemistry model
 (McCormack et al. 2006 \cite mccormack_et_al_2006).
 Monthly and zonal mean ozone production rate and ozone destruction
 rate per unit ozone mixing ratio were provided by NRL based on
 CHEM2D model.
 Original version of these terms were provided by NASA/DAO based on
 NASA 2D Chemistry model - GSM is capable of running both versions
